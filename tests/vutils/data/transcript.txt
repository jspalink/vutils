The Catch and Shoot podcast is a presentation of two hits Media Catch and Shoot. Goes well with both red and white, and it's perfect. What counts of your choice? Co-hosts are on both coasts and they have all of NBA Nation covered. Adam Some two in the Bay Area and no Kozlov in the Big Apple. I'm Adam Stanko. With me is no Kozlov, as always. And Noah, you and I have been been doing this podcast for what I don't know, six, nine months, something like that. I'm not sure how much time, but I don't think that there was a guest that I was more nervous about interviewing than. Then the great Larry Brown, only because there's so much to get to in his life. And I felt like I didn't want to miss anything in my preparation, not necessarily what we would ask him about, but in terms of just being prepared that if he took it anywhere, that I'd be familiar with what he had done in his life. And I think as people hear this this interview, they're gonna find out that you took the same approach and were super well-prepared coming into this thing. Yeah, I think it's funny he said that that nervous about. See, I was more nervous. I'd say not nervous, but a more butterflies before speaking to Mike Breen because he does. The lead voice, the NBA on on ABC and ESPN. So that and that's that's where I aspire to be on the play by play world. So someone that you look up to like that, I don't know. Larry Brown, you know, I know Mike Breen just a little bit. But thinking about interviewing Larry Brown, I was more nervous thinking about it or more anxious thinking about how it would come off to the listeners if they end up at the end saying how how could they not have asked about this? So I hope we got to enough because it's impossible to get to everything and we didn't want to. We don't want to just run all over the place and say, OK. So you were here and then you're here, why did you leave here? Then you were here, why did you leave here? That to me isn't that's not a conversation. And we wanted to have a conversation. And I think that's what we did and the conversation started with. And he's the Hall of Famer, Larry Brown. He's the only head coach with an NCAA title and an NBA title as a head coach. He did it in 88 with Kansas, Danny And. the miracle is Danny Manning. Then he did it no for with the Pistons and they beat the Lakers. He also won in a big title as a player in 69 with the Oakland Oaks. You won an Olympic gold medal in 64 In. Tokyo is a three time NBA all star His. number eleven is honored at the University of North Carolina. He took eight different NBA teams to the playoffs. So how do you start a conversation with Larry Brown? Well, let's start with coach. What did you do yesterday? And as from talking us today, what else are you doing? Well, I'm just recovering from my fourth hip surgery, so. I I actually went Quin Snyder, who worked for me when I was with the Clippers, invited me to. Vegas spent some time in Vegas with the Jackson. Learned a lot. Even though I don't understand the game anymore, it's a different game. But. Those great being around Quinn and his staff and watching the players and. Then it took me two days to get out of Vegas on my flight, got canceled. But I'm in Dallas. My kids slept. SMU and I'm trying to figure out what to do next. What do you want to do next? Well, I'd like to do what Tex Winter and Johnny Bock and Pete Corral the, you know, go to some team and help young players and maybe young coaches. But I think. The game has changed so much that. I don't think they've put a lot of stock in older guys. The value of old coaches, so I don't really know. I get to watch a lot of people, you know, have been important in my life. But a coach still played for me and they invited me, they always invite me to watch him practice. Give my ideas and I'm the one that always learns. Spent two years in Philly watching Jay Wright coach, which was. An unbelievable experience in a positive way and that to see some other Philly guys. So that was fun, but. You know, I've just been with so many great coaches. I'd like to share what I was taught. These young players. Coach, you you mentioned that time they spent in Philly when you had a couple of years there, and I know you've described that period as those coaches saving your life. How why was that the case? Well, I'm not real good with idle time. And you know, this game's been so good to me. You know, coaches been a big part of my life. And there's just having Jay allow me to come by and. Watch him and. Up to him every day and be around his players in his program was. Phenomenal. And you know, Shelly, you know, with all the. The great schools, their coaches and then the high school culture. I had a lot of fun in that regard. It allowed me to stay around the game and stay connected. But Jay was. 0 1, you know what incredible, coach years, but he's a better guy and. This to watch the way coach and. Dealt with his players and staff and made me feel part of it was just amazing fire. I loved every minute of that. Now, I know you took great pride in how you looked on the sidelines. But how does that compare to what Jay goes through? What do you mean? I mean, I know I know how I know how long it took you to pick out suits and make sure you look good on the sideline. J. J is on another level. I did it. I was lucky I had to deal with the money and they took care of me. I think Jay gets this close custom made. He was all different kinds of pocket squares. He's always dressed to the nines, but I was pretty proud of the way I dress. Yeah. You know, people took good care of me. I grew up. My dad died when I was young, but I had a cousin that. I was the same size as I was, and even though he's passed me down his clothes. So he's cared about how I looked and then playing Coach Maguire. Coach Smith, they cared very much about how they looked. Matter of fact, when I was Coach Smith's assistant. We had to wear a tie and jacket to work every day because he was always. Concerned a prospect that his family might come in and visit. He wanted us to look professional and. Meant a lot to him and always meant a lot to me. I think we're gonna get into a little dress code stuff later on them when we talk about Iverson. I want to go back to something you said about not understanding the game anymore. What? What about the game? Don't you understand and haven't been able to grasp? But I think players are playing to young. If you if you look around now. The culture of the game that come in. I don't. I don't mind guys coming out like you can come out and baseball. You know, after high school, you can play tennis or golf when you're young or be a musician. But basketball is different. You know, years and years ago, if you look at the benches of NBA teams, they were with veteran players. And when the veterans got a chance to play, they were prepared to play. And it was all about winning. Now we get these 19 year old kids, everybody strapped in on based on their athleticism and potential. And I don't know if they're all ready. I don't know if they all understand how to play and I don't think it's their fault. You know, when you go to college now and you play one year, people put you in a system. And they really don't get a chance to really teach you, you know, when I was my first coaching job, I was a freshman coach at North Carolina. Look, you didn't even play till after your freshman year. And that whole year was spent on fundamentals. Now the young kids go to teams that most of the time the best prospects go to change with losing records. And maybe there's a reason there's. There is a losing record. Maybe there's. You know, bad management, maybe it is not the best coaching, maybe there's not the best culture in the locker room. You know, maybe. There are veteran players that are teaching kids how to respect the minutes they get. And I think they're put in a real difficult situation, I think is their fault. You know, I know the G League is is a really good way to learn. I think it's it's gotten better because now each team has their own, you know, G League affiliate and a lot of the teams. You know, want to keep goes to Geely. They're doing the same things that the parent club would be doing in terms of teaching and. And you know, so when they do get up to the NBN level there, where the terminology and the values that teammates may have, but. I still think it's it's it's a video game now, a three point shot, the bad shots. You know, the way the game's referee now, Allen, would average 50. And Michael Jordan, you know, Jake, you can't even get near a guy. And it's really hard to guard. So shot selection is different. This analytic site, you know, I trust all the information you can get to me is great. But I was doing analytics when I was 14 years old and I was taught to look at a stat sheet. Know what a good shot was, what a bad shot was. The fact that we had to get to the free throw line a lot. We had to take a high percentage shot. We had to take care of the ball. We had to guard our own man. We had to get back on defense. You know, we had to make our teammates better, do what we did best. Now, I think there's so many analytics that are. They can place that out. People are forgetting more. Kids are cut inside what their heart is like. And the greatest quality, I think, is when you're a coach. You don't have to beg a guy to play hard. How do you evaluate that? You know, coaches that have to coach effort usually don't last very long. I don't know. I I admire the ability of guys. You know, when I watch Golden State play, I'm just mesmerized by. The way the ball moves and the. The way each guy makes sacrifices for one another, but not everybody can play like Golden State. They have five guys that can get a rebound. And initiate the fast break and they're all will and passes. I don't see that and I don't see the ball going inside. And when I was taught to play, you know if, you got the ball inside, you had a chance get power. You had a chance. Take a high percentage shot. You had a chance to get an offensive rebound. And the last thing you had a chance to get back on defense and transition defense was was vital. So. I don't know. Just different. When you were coaching in the NBA, it was it was known around the league that you were a guy that didn't play rookies very much as you as you alluded to. How much of that was that's not sure. That's not true. You know, Buck Williams and David Robinson were rookie of the year when I coached my I played the best players. Larry used to play for me in Philly early in the year. Jermaine, Jeff Jones, who you probably don't even remember, started your house against in order. Lake Right. Yeah. Todd McCulloch played me. I played young players if they deserved the right to play. But fortunately, in a lot of cases, you know, I had older play players that maybe were a little bit better or understood what we needed to do or taught to young kids out of play. You know, it is what it is. These young players now, though, you've got to remember. Look at the rosters of teams now and the benches that teams out. They're not like they were years ago. You know, when I went to Detroit, I didn't play rookies because we had Darko Miller check and he won ready because we had minimal core Ben Wallace. You know, Rasheed. WALLACE But memo corn imitation prince for a second year, guys and, they they started or played right away. So it just depends on what your teams made up. In that that 2003 draft that the Darko obviously went went second. The next three players were Carmelo Chris, Bosh and Dwayne Wade. And people have always wondered what does it look like if one of those guys ends up on the Pistons instead of Darko? So in your words, what does that what does that look like? Not necessarily in 2004, but also the ensuing years. But I think if they had kept that chain together, regardless of dark ghost progress or not, they would have won about six championships. But. B, when I got there. The talk was they were going to draft Carmelo without question, because obviously you knew it was going no one. And then they asked me and I said, you know, I spent a lot of time with Tom Crane, so I knew, you know what? You know Marquette very well. And I told them I loved playing Wade. And Randy Ayres was very close to Chris Bosh. Just kids play a few with him and love Chris. And. Nobody, you know. They they brought dark going to work out and he was really talented. But he couldn't get through five minutes an hour workout. And I was surprised that we made the choice. But if you looked at his ability. And as telling me at a lot that he was an 18 year old young kid. That never played at a higher level than the third division in Yugoslavia. And when it came to us. You know, you felt because you second pick in the draft, you should be starting. And it was a real hard adjustment form. But you know, how you see those other guys were great and turned out great. But what people forget after we won the championship. They let. Bunch of guys go. Mike James who, started for us. They let go. Core. They let go. Corliss Williams and they let go. Elden Campbell was let go. And we didn't matter very much. We only added. Antonio you guys, who is who is great for us coming off injury? So I think that team would have won four years and then, you know, I got sick with 17 games. We lost the home court and ended up losing in Game 7, and then Darko started to feel and understand that I wanted a medicine inside player. And he was getting better that second year and then broke his hand light. But. You know, when you look at that graph, then you look at what we have in the past. So. I'm just amazed at what that team might have been like. Do you remember your conversations that night with the front office? Oh, I remember all our conversations. But, you know, we had. We had a great fun all this, you know, Joe traded and got Chauncey and got Ben Wallace. You know, I walked in. It was the first time I went, by the way, nine and my teams went to the playoffs. I think 0 9. OK. I don't know. But which we don't. Which one do you think I forgot? I don't know. But but but if you look at, you know, Detroit was the only team I ever inherited with a winning record. You know, they lost four straight to Orlando. And I think that's why Rick might have gotten fired. But. I inherited a really good team, and the only thing Joe asked me and John Hammond was I want you to play more core and chop and taste shown up. We want to see if they can play. We think they can play. So we did that and obviously they could really play. But we just all got involved in it. I was really surprised we got drafted. Darko But I you know, if you looked at them and you realize he's 18 years old and you saw a skill level. They were convinced he was really a player. Now, Carmelo wanted his agent, wanted him to come in and work out against them. And the same thing with Wade and Bosh. But. It was smart enough not to let them work out with anybody. And as a result, we made the text still won the championship. And I still think. You know, if we would have kept some of those players and maybe, you know, I'd miss those games, we might have won again and maybe in six. You know, cost me my job because. You know, Mr.. Davidson Why not? When I came back at the end of my second year, yes, my age, and if I could guarantee you might be healthy. You know, for the rest of the next season and then they've gotten a big argument. Next thing I know, he told me a. You know, I want you to come back. But we got another coach. Come and watch you stay. And I didn't think that would be fair. The new coach of. Unfortunately, that was the end of my two year stay in Detroit. So you think about that time with the with the Pistons. I'm always curious when you were coaching the Nuggets. You know, you were picking players up at the airport, taking them to look for apartments and cars and, you know, taking to the movies, the racetrack. When you're with the Pistons, how much? Now, that's a championship team. How much of that? That same stuff was still going on. That at first it was tough because. You know I, was I was asking certain players to change roles. I mean, I was really difficult with Chauncey. And it was it was kind of a challenge. But after about two months. That team was like family to me. Almost everywhere I've been, I've had a close relationship with the players. Now, I don't think I always handle every player the right way. Some might. I'd like to take back, but I've always felt a close relationship not only with the players but with my staff, and my staff always had unbelievable relationships with players. I don't. You know, I don't buy this, that you can't have that kind of situation it's, a little more difficult. Now. Because so many players have so many people involved with their lives. It's it's not as easy to get as close to them as you would like. I think there's a big difference in the NBA and. In college in that regard, because pro players have family and have responsibilities, but. You know, just. When I look back on it, the relationships that I established with your players, whether it's pro or college and the coaches. That makes your job special. Who are the players that come to mind that you didn't handle the right way? This was a few I'd like to keep to myself. Not many I can count on my one hand, I think, but. But again, your job as a coach is to bring out the very best in the people you coach. And to be there for him to help me get better and also to make them understand the importance of, you know, things that I'll help your team be successful and maybe. You know, help you people pass on things. Kids that need to hear that. Because, you know, when some kids walk into a dressing room with a Reggie Miller or a David Thompson or David Robinson or Ben was or she was, people like that. If they'll just take the time to listen and learn from them. You know, their careers are going to be unbelievable. But. But, you know, there are times where you always wish that, hey, maybe a fighter. Got it a little differently with somebody, maybe it would have turned out a little bit better, but I don't have too many regrets in that regard because I'm not. Every day I came to practice, my whole goal was to make my coaches better and share what I was taught. And be there for the players. And. I don't think I should many people in that regard. Yeah, you mentioned the relationships that you've had with your staff and just mentioned David Robinson. Can we go back to Pop and how did you even find him and what made you bring him to Kansas as an unpaid coach? Well, Coach Smith worked for Bob Spear at the Air Force Academy after coach graduated. Q You went in the service and he was stationed in Denver before the academy moved to Colorado Springs and he was Coach Spears assistant Pop played for. Boats spear. And you know, I was close to Hank Kagan when I was coach in Denver and. I was coach to coach Spear and I met Pop when he was at the academy. Matter of fact, Mr. Ibe asked me to help with the Olympic trials and. Seventy two and Greg tried out for that gene and then he actually tried out for the Denver Nuggets and I cut it weeks. Well, what was his game like? Why'd you cut him? He was a hell of a player. But at the time we had. Pretty good team in Denver, but I think he could have been a big player and possibly an NBA player. He had certain commitments obviously coming from the academy, but we kept the relationship. And then I remember Coach Smith used to invite me to Chapel Hill every year and. Before this season, well, as college coach, a pro coach and with chalk and pop was on a sabbatical at Chapel Hill at the time, it was going to go there and then spend time with me. And then I forget where else he was going to go after he left me at Kansas. But. He wasn't doing a lot in Chapel Hill. I just said, come on with me and sit on the bench. Can you? And I don't know if you looked at who was coaching with me. Case, you had a pretty amazing staff and. He sat on the bench with me and then Benny went back to promote pitcher. We even played a game against them when I was in Kansas. I try to give him some money to help his budget. And then we just remain close. And when I got the Spurs job. I brought him and R.C. Buford and Alvin Gentry and Ed Manning with me. And many left for one year to go to Golden State. And yes, to come back. Came back to San Antonio with me. And you know, whereas this kind of history. Howard, I'm afraid I've had some pretty good guys sit next to me. You know, I've done pretty well, a lot of people say that the tree I have a farms, so I'm pretty I'm pretty happy about that. Your coaching forest is is certainly remarkable. What? What was Popovich and R.C. Buford like in those in those early days? Nah, she was just getting ready. You know, he's still a college student, so he was in there. He was in a growth process. Just growing up. But it was a really good guy. Pop. Bob just has unbelievable values. His bride is Charlie has a great background and he respects the game. I was not afraid to coach guys. It's not looking to be a friend. He's looking to make you better. If your fortune enough to be around those guys, you're going to benefit. But he. He had an unbelievable background. You know, when you play for Bob Spear and Keegan. Those are two pretty incredible coaches, and I think they influence pop in a lot of possible ways. After he won the championship in 88 with that miraculous team, you know, there was talk about you returning to UCLA. And it really is one of the most seminal moments in all of college basketball history because Jim Valve Veno is up for that job. Coach K is up for that job. How close were you to to taking that before you ended up going to the. Well, it was kind of crazy. I coached there and 80 and my athletic director, J.P. Morgan by so. That was one of the reasons I left. Probably the main reason I left. And then they came after me in 88 and I wanted to go because we had a new athletic director at Kansas and. I just felt it was there was time for me to go there because I had such a positive experience. Not that I didn't love. Love k u k years was unbelievable. But. When I was flying out, it came right after we won the national championship and they were on the. You know, and I've felt a lot of pressure. And I flew out there and unfortunately, our C got in an accident base where you went there alone. And there was. I got a lot of heat put on me about, you know you, got to take the job, right? Right. That I may be made. Pete Dallas, who was insistent that I didn't take the job right away, they were going to lose all these prospects and. The president in charge so has a chance, so young, who had been there when I was there before he tried to calm, beat Dallas down and say, no. Give Larry time, because I told him I had to go back out of all the players. We had a parade. We had a banquet. There were so many things that I needed to take care of before I could, you know, say, hey. I'm going to do it. Just give me a couple of weeks to think about and. And when I went back in all the kids or happened to be in my house, I couldn't say I was going to UCLA. I even though I told Champs a young, just give me two weeks and I'll be able to do it. And so that's how it kind of ended up then, Terry. Donna, you supposed to call me and say, hey Larry,, give as much time as you want to take your time and. It just didn't happen, and then the next thing I knew. Brad McCall came and flew in into Kansas and said, Larry, I want you to come and take over the Spurs and be president and coach and GM. And I did it. I don't know why I did it, I like him a lot. He he's really a charismatic guy and a great guy. And I ended up in the debate. No, I didn't want to look back on it. It's just kind of crazy situation that happened. And then so when you got back to Kansas and you told UCLA, give me two weeks. Your team, your actual team was in your home when you arrived back home. Yeah. Where? Came by and we talk. I'll talk to you about it. You know, like I had made up my. By the time the two weeks happened, after I told the kids I was going to stay. You know, when I came back from UCLA and then. Just started getting all these calls again and I had second thoughts about. But whether I should spare Kansas or not, I was I had some issues that I was trying to deal with. So it just happened. And. Turned out UCLA got wrong. I mean, UCLA ended up winning the championship two years later with Jim Herrick and, you know, Kansas got Roy Williams and. You know, I ended up. Getting to be around some pretty incredible people with the Spurs and a great honor. Top seed David Robinson, Terry Cummings. You can go on and on. So. You know, you spend it up that way. You mentioned that you don't have many regrets with players. Do you have and maybe this situation is is one of them to a certain extent. You have any regrets leaving any of the jobs? Oh, all of. You know, I mean. There were. Job one. You know, I. We don't have enough time. I had a great reason believe in everyone, I thought. A couple I was told that the. But. I can't imagine any. Anybody who's had the opportunities I've had. To regret what what happened with the situations I was given. Not everybody. Yeah. God, I feel so fortunate that. I was allowed to do that, but. If I sit down and try to explain why I left people, people have their own opinion and I've read stories that left UCLA because I'd put them on probation. That was the furthest thing from the truth. You know, I left Kansas. One of the main reasons I got in trouble at Kansas City. This family was having trouble and ice itself reported find somebody's home, which now as is legal. And there are a lot of things that have come out that aren't exactly really true. But to be honest. When need coach in the NBA, when you get to coaching college and you get to play at the highest level. You just gotta be thankful for that and hope that you get the best you could with the people you were working with, and when you look at some of the people that I've had, the opportunity that have changed my life in a positive way and you see. Their careers have turned out it's. You feel pretty, pretty import. I'm pretty fortunate that that's the way I look at it. All I want to say on that for a moment, but it's something from Kansas. This ritual that I heard about on the bench with your coaches, the heart of the farce that you've grown, called the power coaches that squeeze their left testicle. That came from Coach Maguire. But you can't use it all the time. Well, yeah. Sometimes I use that. It really worked. I remember one time my. My first year at UCLA when I set every kind of record possible. First time we ever lost FC at home. First time UCLA ever lost an opening game in poorly. It was the first time we didn't win the conference championship tonight. How many years was the first time you lost? Two games in a row. I can go on and on. But that team ended up losing in the final game. The Louisville. But I remember we were playing Ohio State when they probably had the best college game I'd ever seen that Clark Kellogg and. Kelvin Ramsey and Herb Williams. They. They were just incredible. And that was to keep possession, and I told the kids the power well that there was no shot clock and the possession went on for an hour, it seemed like, and guys return and blew. On the bench. But we eventually had to jump up and call a time out and we ended up before it time out was. Been acknowledged, we made a three point play. A guy got south and Darren Day made a layup, got fouled, made a three point play and went in the game against the team that. I thought it was the best college team that ever seen play. It's great. Did you did you ever try that in the NBA? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We have that we're getting coaches and players to grab their left testicle. Well I, didn't know exist players because they might have had a rebellion, but my coaches were so, so loyal, they do anything that's funny. What are those guys? One of those guys was was Donnie Walsh. Of course, you go way back with he said back in 84 that you never saw the effects of the mistakes in ever, that you never saw the effects of the mistakes that you made on people. You agree with that? I don't know what you mean by. He said bye bye bye. Moving around like you did. You said that you never really calculated. And he said that he never saw the effects. His mistakes made on people. I don't know, but I don't know about that. You know, Donnie, Bonnie and I were teammates together. Carolina met Madam Fact. Years Coach McGuire's godson. And we both Coach Smith hired us both. I was playing in the NBA. He asked me to come back and coach. And daddy was going to be the other coach, and then Coach McGuire left the Warriors and went to South Carolina. Daddy went with him. And then John Lott came with me with Coach Smith. But and then. After 13 years at South Carolina, hi, Donny, come with me and he was going to coach and then eventually become the GM. That was the deal we had worked out. Now he is one of the. My dearest friends and. You know, somebody I have a great deal of admiration for, but I hope he thinks that I'll overlooked people's mistakes or I'd never looked back. You know, I don't know. I don't know, I never maybe I never realized when I left some place. The effect it had on other people. Maybe that that's the case. And if that is, I feel bad about that because it's something you should consider. Regarding those those North Carolina coaches that you played for Frank McGuire and Dean Smith, obviously we could do days and days and it wouldn't cover what. What you probably learned from them. But when you think back on your time with both of those guys, what what are some of the big memories that you have? Well, Coach Maguire recruited my mother. You know, my dad passed away when I was young. So she told me I was going to North Carolina's. Pretty pretty good research on many Lao, you know. That was that was really Charles. And he was so different from coach. Well, he might have been the greatest game coach of all time. Practice All. we did was scrimmage. Which was. So much fun when Coach Smith took over, he was more. I guess you'd say every teacher every,. Every practice she had a, practice plan, every drill was timed. Every drill is basketball specific. It was like going to a classroom and that's when I first played for him. I didn't know if I could handle it. It was so different than Coach McGuire, but. God, the more you are around them, the more you realize that. God made this special person that nobody will ever be like. When you were done playing, that was when you realized. How much he loved you, how much he cared about you. Not that coaching required. I mean, with coaching, I always stayed in my life, but. Dean called me up almost every day, asking if there was anything I needed. Invited me back to Carolina. Always making me feel like I was something special. Do we have a couple of minutes? I'll give you a couple of interesting stories. I think we've got as long as as long as you have. We've got it. Yep. Well. I remember we had the ninth pick in the draft when I was in Denver one year. Coach Coach Murphy always helped me in that draft because he always knew he always had guys that were potentially going to be picked. And they would always share information with me, which might help you when you're kind of prepare for the draft and maybe have a selection you want that you, know somebody, else might take. So one year we had nice pick in the draft. Then he called me up and said, New Jersey's going to take Tommy Legarde at number four. And I said, coach, we don't need Tommy Legarde, but I heard. I'm glad you told me that because, you know, we heard they were going to take Bernard King. I'm pretty sure that and. So he said, well, who are you going to take? And I said, well, we like. The Londo black man and would like to Rawlins. You know we're, gonna get a good ticket number nine and they're gonna go good with David Thompson and Bobby Jones and they are Dennis. So we're going to show. And whenever I got information I, always shared it with owners, it's a little different now because when I was coaching most of the time I I watch college and I would always call my college friends to find out about players and when we'd bring them in to work out, I worked them all out because even though you might bring in fifty five guys, you might only draft two. But I wanted kids to know I cared enough about them. The word come out and then I wanted to see if they accepted coaching or not. You know, what kind of kids they were. But to make a long story short. We had 32 owners, but one to one of the main guys was called Shear my, general manager really was a business guy. Great guy. And he said, who we're going to draft then were you always put down the tops hundred guys because the draft was a little deeper than by order for we thought using our scouts and our coaches, everybody had input and then we'd do it by position. And the rule of thumb is we're going to take the best player no matter what. You know, and prepare for the draft that way, and if it was close, we might go by position, but not normally, we'd always go. Best player, but for two minutes before the draft. Coach called me up and told me Tommy regard card as physical. And New Jersey was taking Bernard King and he said, You're taking Tommy. The guard hung up. So now I'm afraid to tell my own is that and which calls sheer. And I found out that Tommy would die that long because he had a bad knee. Well, the drought going on in New Jersey, sure enough, took Renard then five, six, seven, when all of a sudden we're going to take three rounds from Bernard King and everybody's idea. And you only have five minutes in the draft. Everybody's dying to know who I'm going to tell them to take. And you've got to tell the guy in Denver to call New York and tell him to. So the eighth take went in, both them were still there and now everybody's going crazy. What are you going to do, Larry? No. So. I whispered into the guys in the Denver Nuggets with a nightstick. Take Tommy with God. Well, everybody heard it. They went crazy. Tommy the guard. And by that time they'd gotten around that he had flunked physical. And people weren't real excited about me. We flew him in. He flunked out physical. And when we find them, there was an exception made that if he hurt that knee we, didn't pay him. But if we traded him as full contract was going to be guaranteed. So we were playing golf that summer. Oh, by the way, we traded Lenny Wilson wanted to get rid of a guy and we knew he knew about Tommy and wanted Tommy, even though the timing could play maybe one game and maybe have to sit out a game. So I'm playing golf with coach that summer. And I said, Coach, why did you make me take Tommy? You knew he couldn't play. You knew he was so. And he said, Larry, I knew you'd be all right. And that was just that was just now. Now is the kind of person he was. And I if you look back on my career. I dropped everybody from Carolina. Anybody told me to. No matter what. Met a matter of fact, we had the 16th pick, which is the last pick in one draft, and I was going to take Scott Williams and he called me and said, don't you dare take Scott Williams as 60 as a coach. We had him down in the top 20. In the draft, he said, well, if you take him, he's stuck with you otherwise. Now he's got twenty nine other teams that can go after him and that was when you didn't have to guarantee a second round contract. So I ended up going to Chicago, getting a bonus and winning about three championships with Michael Jordan. So then you have in Philadelphia. Yeah, well, I ended up in Herald and it's kind of created in contract and people really, really tough on him because when NERA. When you're a role player on Michael Jordan and then all of a sudden you're. You expect that to be a star? Going somewhere else? It's not the easiest thing. So but but the moral of the story is, you know, Koch cared so much about the people that played for him. And coach with them, that is loyalty to you and them, as was without exception. There was an incredible. Probably the greatest team coach of any team sport. I mean, what did he tell package? What did Dean Smith tell you, Coach, about trying to play Stackhouse and Iverson together? He said never work. When he was right. You know, it was so unfair. Jerry. As Jerry was there before I was little and they used to call the Spectrum Stackhouse. And then all of a sudden the, first pick in the draft is Allen Iverson, and they're supposed to play together and. You know it, just it wasn't a good fit because one. Allen was not a true point guard. Allen was just this incredible, incredible score. And Jerry was also and and it was just a hard combination to play together. And I couldn't figure out how to use them. To be honest with you. Both unbelievably talented. And then, you know, we ended up. Trading cherry, he went to Detroit. We ended up getting Theo Ratliff and. And the key, which is too unbelievable, players that compliment Allen allowed now to be Allen. Then we've got George Lynch by accident. We've got Tyron Hill by accident. We've got Eric Snow's fourth string point guard for Seattle. And all these guys allowed Allen to be out. And I you know, I quite honestly had to learn how to use them because I used to tell Al and if you're the point guard your, ideas try to beat five guys. Dozier Competitiveness, if I could get you to. Figure out to play off the ball and figure out ways to get you the ball and have people around you to sacrifice to allow you to do those things. It would be easier for you and. It took him a while to understand that. But. Eventually, I think he became the most exciting player in the. Never play maybe. And it was one easy for him. And there were a lot of things that. You know I, had to learn or adjust to and I had to surround them with players that. You know, truly accepted and allowed Allen to be our man. It's probably one of the greatest, you know, things that have ever happened in my life. You know I, think if I had to do it all over again, I could have done better. In terms of him, but I'm really excited about what he accomplished and. It helped me so much to be around him. And now the more I look back on it. Even though there were some heartaches involved in it, it was probably one of the most important times of my life. You've said they you could say almost anything to Iverson privately, but if it was in front of a group or his teammates that that he couldn't handle it. How did you discover that? Probably the first time I ever. You know, I tried to coach him. He had so much pride. Which made him so great. That it was hard for him to accept anybody to get on and front as a group. But that being said, in private legal, we could. We could share anything with one another. And he accepted, you know, coaching and what I was trying to do right in front of the group. It was very difficult. So the only way I could get. Things are crossed. Allen in front of the group. To get on Eric Snow, McKee or Theo can be a tie roan. And they understood, you know, while he's getting on them and Alan had such a love for his teammates. That he would get get upset with me. You know. Which was kinda kind of interesting, but it. You know, there are a lot of things, you know, we can talk about practice and not common and not caring about it, but every time he stepped on the court, try to play a game. You knew he was trying to win no matter what and would take full responsibility for whatever happened. And his teammates admire that. You know, teammates. Some teammates couldn't play with them. You know, every year everybody kept telling Billy King and myself and ownership that we needed to bring in other scores to play with them. And in so many cases, it was not a good thing. You know, he needed a different kind of players around and allow him to do the things he was capable of doing. So it didn't always work out, but. Maybe the greatest small man ever to play may be had the greatest heart of anybody may be the toughest player to ever play, I don't know. But you'd be hard pressed to tell me anybody any different. Yeah, I know Adam and I both grew up in the Philadelphia area, so we're certainly not going to agree disagree with you on how tough Iverson was. Is there a did you have a moment with with Iverson that you thought that you'd never get over? That's comical that I've been every day. You know, every day is like going to church and going to confession and then, you know, and everything's going to be I. Tomorrow. But but again, you know, my relationship with him now is only grown and grown and gotten better and better, I brought him back just some new to talk to my team. I think everybody plays this game or a hero. Tom. Because it tells you the good and the bad things you could have done, definitely. You don't make excuses. It's amazing. I think the league should hire to let them go around and tell these young kids until, you know, I'm being coach in the last few years. But everywhere I go in the airports, a lot of people don't know my name. But they know I coach down. Every team that you know that I've been invited to watch play. After practice. Kids come over to me and always ask me about Al, and almost every one would tell me he's their favorite player ever. It's just remarkable. You know, I like to tell him about that because I used to get on him all the time. Let them know. That he never realized the positive, the fact. He had on people and how many people, you know, just admired him and most certain things that if he were just. You know, try to be a little bit different than he could have so much more of a positive effect on young kids. And it was difficult for him because he had he had so many people that were in the rear. He had so many people. He was taken care of. It was it was not easy for him. But in terms of the effect he had on the game and his teammates and me, even though there were days that were difficult in those private moments. Did. Did he open up to you about everything else that was going on in his life? Was he. Was he more vulnerable in those one on one moments? Oh, yeah. He we both opened up to each other. So, you know, everybody has things that. You know, sometimes you have to share with other people that you care about. No care about you. But. But again, you know, you look back on it in your hope at the time, you did the very best you could with them. But I look back on them, there are so many more things now that I wish I could have done better. Again, Matt. I was lucky to have the coaches around me that I did. I'll give you the A story the first time ever took Allen out of the game when he walked by the bench. He kind of messed me up and I almost jumped up and wanted a fight and my coach was just kind of throwing me down. And I took them out the end of the first quarter because they gave me a chance to give him a long rest and then I put him in the beginning as second quarter and then I did it at the end of the third quarter. Same thing happened. You know, because the guy hated to ever leave the court. You want to play 48 minutes every game. And, you know, emotionally, he's going to tell you exactly how he feels. And if you get sensitive to that, you know, you're not going to be able to handle it. But people been on my ass to write a book and I Oh. , and he always wanted to write a book. To share what I was part, you know, just not a show and tell book or basketball book because I played for the greatest coaches of all time. If you go back over who I played for and I coached the greatest players and I sat next to the greatest coaches and I wanted to share their ideas, but I could never think of a title. And now I coach down 600 games and the M asked me twelve hundred times. So that would be the title of my book. Well, we could start now. We can start the audio book with this with this podcast. How about that. Yeah. But goddamn it. I was I was gonna ask you, you know, in dealing with with Iverson and having this relationship you, didn't trying to figure him out. Most curious, in addition to the coaches. What what other players that you were around that that experience greatness and competitiveness. Did you talk to about your relationship with Iverson and how to get through to him? I mean, were there discussions with Michael Jordan or with David Thompson or guys in the past? I know you've referenced the fact that Rick Berry was a guy that didn't really like the practice, but brought it on game day. So. So when you think back to the players that you had relationships with, who did you reach out to in those circles and try to discuss your relationship with Iverson about? Well, I played with Brit right before, recorded his name. He might have been the greatest player I ever saw. And those unbelievable hours with the ultimate no. But he used to frustrate Doug and I like crazy because. He didn't like to practice. David. You know, it was. People don't realize how good David Thompson was, but they were way before Al and after Al and everybody else. Whoever I coached always asked me about Alan. You know, because I really as great as Michael was and it's, you know, on. You know, we we all know. Nobody could be any better than Michael Jordan, even though it's hard to kick. I don't think it's fair when you talk about Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain or Jerry West or ask Robinson. You know. To compare players, they're all different. Larry Bird, you say they're all different. They came from different areas. They played, you know. Different positions, but. Alan, I mean, so many people just love this guy and they had reason to because. You know, you know, the passion of the fans in Philly when when you walk on the court in the arena and Philly and you see what Allen did night in and night out, knowing what he was going through physically. Do not love them. You had to be really careful. For not appreciate what he was trying to do and all the players, a coach would always ask me about guys like David Robinson like, David Thompson, if they knew it, like I would always bring up. Players that I coach, you know, and admired and the qualities that they had. It's you know, I I look at that fairly thing, you know when, you. People always laugh at me, and I knew we would beat the Lakers in 2004 because if we would have been healthy in 2002, I thought we I don't think. You know. Say we were to beat the Lakers because they were phenomenal, but. We had a healthy Matt Geiger or Matt would have played or had George Lynch. But you know, Aaron McKie and Eric Snow playing on bad legs. You know, I don't know what that team might have done in that series, but if you look at that roster, you shake your head and say, how the hell did that team get to the finals? You know, we got Roger Bell out of the YMCA just before the season ended. But the reason they got to the finals is because the character of that group and because Allen Iverson's greatness. And I think everybody in Philly, you know, I can't tell you how many people tell me when I go to back to Philly, but that might have been their favorite team, even though. You know, you won with juice when Billy Cunningham was coach and then. You know, we won and went to Alex Saddam, was there, but they appreciated that team because of the way they played, the way they competed. That's it. It makes me feel great right now. I wish. I wish Alan was more connected instead of just being an ambassador. I wish she was part of that that organization, because I think every every person would benefit by being around them and having him talk about his experiences and, you know, his love for that city and love for that. Kind of. Speaking of the 0 1 team coach, we had Tom McCulloch on last week and Todd said. He said ask as coach if he remembers the time that in a time out. And he asked me, could you could you catch an alley open? And he said, of course. He said he drew up the play. Eric Snow threw the ball at the rim. My feet didn't leave the ground. Ball sails out of bounds. Coach never drop in value from me ever again. You remember that. But I remember we used to talk about this all the time. You could look at Todd Eye, Billy Billy night between Excuse and Billy King, he did an unbelievable job. It was great to me. I remember when I. But the job missed the spider. You want to make me president and coach GM, everything. And I said, you can't coach a guy and tell him he's the greatest and then negotiate a contract. Sure. I said so. I said, I don't know if I could do that, Mr. Snyder. And I said, I've got a young kid named Billy King that I think is really. Can be a great GM and he didn't want to have. Even think about that. And I said, give me a year and then all of a sudden. You know, Mr. Snyder realized how great Billy was and the Maven became really, really, really close. Think it might have been the toughest thing that Snyder ever did. Justifiably, but. I just. Kind of lose in thought. But Billy, in the draft, I think we drafted Todd at 55. If I'm not mistaken, at the University of Washington. And had watch Todd play and. Chief seem nothing like anybody I would draw out because I always wanted long athletic. Guys that could play multiple positions. But he had. He did the most unusual things out politically that a guy his size would blow your way, not jumping was not one of. But he really had a quick twitch and he had unbelievable hands. And it is kind of funny you when we're talking about it. I don't think we talked about this on this show. But when you draft that sack around guys at that time you, only gave guarantee them two years and then they were free agents unless. I don't think you could give many long longer term contracts. And he had two pretty good years. And he became a free agent and he told me, said, Coach, I want to stay here. And money is not not going to be the deciding factor. I just want to stay and be part of this team. And New Jersey offered him 36. Was at the time, which was a huge contract. And I remember he came in and we Billy and I met in a conference room with his wife. And his agent and Todd and Todd came out and said, coach you, know we, got off this great contract, but, you know, money's not going to be the deciding factor. Next thing I knew, his wife grabbed his arm and a kind of guard martial a little bit. And then Billy and I looked at him and said, you know, that kind of money you can't pass up. And he ended up leaving. And unfortunately, that strange disease in his foot and never really got to play much longer, even though I think he went to the conference finals within that one year. We went to get a new one next year. And then the land. Yeah, right. The NBA finals. Right. But cut. Todd was in the accuse. But he didn't. We didn't throw many more logs. Remember that time out? But I always drew up plays out the timeouts. A back guarantee I didn't drop. I no love play. I had some quick gators going. What's your favorite Broadway show? Well, my mom took me to My Fair Lady when rec showers soon and Julie Andrews were in it. That was that was great. I like stop the world. Blame is now is probably. The one I loved the music most, but that was one of the neat things all my contract. I was always allowed or we can do your. I go to the U.S. Open in them during the day in a Broadway show at night. Well, I grew up. I grew up with my mom. Have an appreciation. For Broadway, and my brother and I used to go whenever we could. And that still hadn't changed. Your your favorite car other than your 58 Corvette. That's in storage. My favorite car. Well, my funniest one is the first new car I got. Was a nineteen I think sixty seven red box rag, and then my grandfather was mad at me that I bought a German car and some Jew. But I think my favorite car ever got when I when I signed to play. Coach Charlotte, my bonus was I got a small. The 300 Mercedes that was to tell. That was brown and had a kind of like a pearl top. And I thought that was a gift from God. I was pretty neat. I'd say it was the last house you bought. Wow. Laughs House. Who would have guessed one in Philly? The last one I bought. Couture is a love show. We got ya. We all do. But when I went tests, I knew I ended up getting a condo that I could walk to campus and both my kids happened to come here, which I didn't realize was such an extra benefit. So that turned out great. Where are they? They needed a meal or needed to do a laundry or something like that. They would come hang out. Coach, who's your favorite current player? Wow, there's a lot of my love. That's kind of that's kind of hard. Such appreciation for some of them. The team that made this to me now. Here's what guys do and given back, you know, I recently went to a reunion. Good. Good year. You know where I played after college when there weren't a lot of NBA teams in the industrial league was so great. And it was right by a school that LeBron just built. And I start to hear about. So many of these things these players have given back. That's. That's making me feel pretty good. But. If I had a turn on a TV, I'd be more about games and teams playing. Then favorite players, because there's so many I love. Bar. You have a. A favorite all time roll player that you coached. I know everybody asks me my favorite player, a coach or the bomb, but that's why I was homeless. I was going with roll player. I had so many great role players. It's unbelievable. I could I could give you up. I'll give you an example. When we got David Robinson. Beirut was kind of a nerd and I'm not in a good way. You know, he played musical instruments and Redding's. He has so many other interests. But when we got him, we needed to bring another guy that was a great player, take some pressure off David, because he didn't want to be the guy. He's all of a sudden he turned into a great player without even realizing it. So we brought Terry Cummings in. But I've met so many guys, you know, that made sacrifices for teams. You look at no and they're key to Cam Bay, Tyrone and feel. And then, you know, I go to Charlotte. I look at Boris Theo and Raymond Felton. I mean, I could I could go on and on. Yes, you're with guys. And I would everybody on my Detroit team, my New Jersey team, my. I mean, it's it's even hard to imagine how lucky I've been. I know I coach the Kansas, North Carolina, UCLA. SMU, I mean. How many guys get to do that? Start in the NBA. Coach A, you be involved with so many Olympic teams being on the Olympic team. Bonnie. I mean, this is just remarkable how how my life. Turned out the way it was because I wanted to. Be a high school history coach and coach, baseball, basketball and football. And all of a sudden, you know, I look back on. But I was allowed to do it's crazy and then when you see. Guys like Pop, you mention in our see Chad Boy on Mark Turgeon, John Calipari. Sell Sounds and gentry. I can go on and on. And and and and Bill Self, see what what they've done and. But they've given back to the game. It's. It's remarkable. And you've got to be lucky to be in that position. You also nine playoff appearances. One was a B.A. to refer back to earlier in the conversation and a good coach. Was that. Well, when I said eight eight NBA and then the NBA made it nine. No. All my NBA teams. But I. I you know I,. Coach Sharp Shaw, the Greens for a rally was my first job and I only got that because they turned down a bunch of guys and Coach Smith. Got me that job. And then. The team was sold. Because Ted Montag bought the team just for a tax write off. He sold a team that St.. Lewis, but he sold every every. No body but me. You said they weren't allowed to take me. And I always try to go anywhere I wanted and I always coach the United States team with Doug Moe. In Russia and the selfish try to harm me and but I didn't realize it cause Scheer, who is with me in Denver, so Denver, Doug and I were going with him in Denver, so I ended up going to Denver. And then Denver, Denver, and just ended up merging with the NBA. If you remember and. Up first here in Denver, we made the NBA playoffs. The four teams from the NBA went to. Went to the NBA we, weren't allowed to take part in the NBA draft. And then we weren't able to take part in the dispersal of. The other teams that weren't taken in the NBA and both San Antonio and Denver both made the playoffs, and that showed you how good the NBA was. Because we both want our division and there were only four divisions, so. But I think I think I was involved with nine NBA teams, so I'm not sure. Well, either either way, when when we compiled a list of the greatest coaches of all time and it's it's an awfully short list. There's no question that that your name is is on that list, coach. I mean it. And I think that's the bottom line. We thank you for all your time. The the this show is the catch and shoot podcast. And so we always like to close out the show. I know this can be difficult because of all the players that you appreciate through the years. But your coaching and you have one guy you could have played with him. Coached him. You could choose one guy. Catch and shoot situation down. One in a game seven. Who are you going? I. My best buddy is Doug Mom,. I'm going with Doug. I mean, I. I mean, this guy restarted together. I played at Carolina where the music scene here took me under his wing. And then when we signed in the NBA, the only reason. I got to play in the NBA, as you said he, wouldn't sign unless they signed me and I was coaching at Carolina and I just turned down the Connecticut job. Coach Smith said, Larry, you'll never get another job. I ended up going with Doug and then we ended up coach in Carolina together when we both too hurt to continue to play and we went to Denver together. And then I begged Doug to go to San Antonio when he had a chance to be a head coach and he didn't want to go. Joe told me I had the greatest job in the world being assistant with me and I never counted on as system. He was like. You know, we were called coaches, but he ended up having an unbelievable career. Very. It would be the one because I was so connected with them. I guess I see YouTube is only like the younger version of Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. Their you know, their relationship. We had it when we got our job in Denver. We had a guy named Frank Hamlin who was left there, and Doug and I took over the job and they used us clearly in. So I don't know that. Doug, most prove special to me, but every you know. Hey. Like I said, there were very few that I coach that I cannot on one hand, that made me feel uncomfortable and. But other than that, nobody could have had it any better than me when you consider that people like Coach than the coaches I've played for and coaches that sat next to me was pretty, pretty lucky. You're going to have a really hard time finding the person that you end up choosing for the foreword to that book. I'll tell you that much with all these names. Now, that's nice of you to say that, but I still want to stay involved in some way. Get up early in the morning and can help some young kids and young coaches and share what I was taught. But I don't know. I think this the way the game is now, when you get older, they think you get dumber. And that troubles me a little bit. Boy, is it possible to do that with Quin Snyder. You know, I don't know. I don't know. I hate this so many. You know, I look at now you look at the stars. People have. It's incredible the number of people they have that work. I. I don't know, I don't. I don't think you look around and see a peak corral. Johnny Bark or Tex Winter sitting on the bench anymore, do you? Yeah. No, no you, don't. It's not at all. And it's it blows my mind because these young kids. Whether they know it or not, at first, they look at you like you're older and as soon as they gain your trust and know you care about a month. Want to share what you've been taught? They'll give you almost anything. I mean, it's incredible. The only one I think of is. I don't know if he's the oldest assistant to lead, but Ron Adams is. He's over 70. That's that's the oldest one I can think of. Yeah, but you know, it had ever been a head coach. Now, no dramas ever had Chris. No. No, not and not in the league. No. And, you know, but, um, I'm sure there's a lot like that. You gotta respect that. You got. You can't have an ego and you can't to threaten. The owners should think of this guy can really help kids get better and coaches get better. That should be the only challenge for anybody. So meet. And that should be the only thing that's really important, because when you you think about, again, we're talking too long. But think about how many kids declare for the draft. But don't get your. And think about how many young kids that are selected early in the draft. The people after, a year or two say that they're a failure. That people aren't really teaching them, that it's not their fault, they're not a failure. They have been given time. And these guys that go to schools that are one and done the, coaches that are phenomenal in college really don't have time to teach and rarely had a play. They've got to put them in a system right away. And it's it's it's not the easiest thing for a kid to make a transition right away. From going from being a great athlete is unbelievable talent, talented they do as a family to support, which none of us had that pressure on when we were growing up, our families made our lives better. Think about the things that these kids have to go through tonight. I think older guys that have been through it before. Can really help. I don't get it yet figured that out. We figured it out. Well, we'll certainly let you know when we started this podcast by asking you what you were doing today aside and talking to us. Well now, that we've taken the entire day, I guess you can focus on tomorrow. I'm going. No, I'm going to go to. I'm going to go to this music practice. They invited me. So I'm going to go watch the. That a little fix, which would be kind of fun. I will. That will be enjoyable. There, they're fortunate to have you around. Coach, we appreciate it. Thank you so much. Nice guys,. Thanks so much. So that was that was something. And despite having an hour and a half with Larry Brown. Certainly not enough time. I mean, it's it's pretty cliche to say, well, you know, if we had more time, we could've gotten into this and that and. Well, sure, I mean, if we had spent 24 hours with around, you still don't get into everything. But I was really pleased with the ground, the ground recovered and how open and honest they seemed to be. Incredibly candid and know it. It's sort of something that we haven't ever really discussed on this podcast before. I've never even asked you this question. So I'm curious now, you know, and Larry Brown probably is the greatest example of this. I've interviewed two coaches that I literally had to ask myself to put two people in my life that I've had to ask myself my career, where do I start with this guy? And the first was Steve Kerr, you know, for his storied history, obviously. So, you know, his recruitment Arizona,, his whole story, and then obviously playing alongside Michael Jordan and under Phil Jackson. And then he goes on to all that all that stuff. And that doesn't even include the warrior stuff and what he's done as a coach and as an announcer, Larry Brown, even more so. And so the question that I was going to ask you and we haven't talked about this is sort of the process in order to get ready for an interview like this. And so what is what is your process? How do you dive into the research? Yeah, I just rely on you. Really? Yeah, I guess so. I when I think of Larry Brown and I think the first. Thing that you want to hear from Ly Brown since since so many people would like to hear so many different things. I'd like to try to. Make a make the question, general, but still specific that might lead to something else. So by asking him, what did you do yesterday what, are you doing today? Would give us a little bit of insight and a little bit of direction of where to take the interview instead of just going, all right. Let's start at the beginning, cause you can't just start at the beginning with Larry Brown. We don't we don't know him personally. Now I feel like I do. And I've interviewed him before, but in a in a much shorter segment for NBA radio on Sirius. So if we ask. What do you do? Yesterday? And then what did you do today and what are you going to be doing today, then that allows us to. Yet some sort of direction on where to take the next question and the jumping off point. Yeah, and what's fascinating is that there's so much to read about him and so many people have opinions and he's touched so much of basketball history. I mean, we got into a ton of it and still I feel like there's stuff that we left in and never really, you know, discussed this time. I mean, what century on him? I mean, imagine they did the our sports century on them. But I don't think that in our first conversation with them like this platform, I wasn't going to ask Larry Brown about. So. So have you now visited your father's grave site because you hadn't for I think it was like 40 years afterwards. And when he was 6 years old and his brother Herb was 11, and they told Herb that their father had died, but they didn't tell Larry until Larry for a few weeks. They thought he thought that he was that his father was travelling like he like he always did. This I mean, I didn't think that this was the. This might be the form for it at some point, but it wasn't for our first conversation with him even, though it lasted now and a half. And that's always hard for an interviewer because it's it's what do you what do you ask? What do you leave in? What do you what do you take out? And then? And then there's things that just in the course of a conversation that he was bringing up that it was important to follow up on. But, you know, I mean, there's there's other stuff that the Bobcats. You know, he was he was fired by Michael Jordan, who was like family to him That. Carolina family, the time that he spent with the Knicks and his relationship with James Dolan was really good. But he felt like Isaiah Thomas, a guy that he always admired and loved, how Isaiah played. And they had a great relationship. He felt like Isaiah wronged him. So there's there's so much about Larry Brown's life and about how he has helped shape the game of basketball, that it's a it's where do you start and be? Where do you go and see, OK, how much you're gonna regret leaving some of those those questions on? I guess the cutting room floor. Yeah, I know. I don't regret any direction that we went in or didn't go in because I also don't. What I appreciate about doing interviews with you, Adam, is that it's not a. You're not getting whiplash doing the interview. Oh, wait, wait. Now they're going here and now they're gonna here it because you just we're trying to have a conversation with Larry and the two of us are trying to stay on the same page and make transitions natural and knowing that we're not in it. I think it's obvious when I listen to interviews, it's obvious when. An interviewer is just trying to fit things in. It's like when you call a game. I use about 10 percent, 20 percent of what I've prepared. If you're just trying to force stuff in, it's too much. It's exhausting for the viewer. You don't want to do that. You've got to react to what is in front of you on the floor or on the field when you're calling a game. And I think the same thing goes for an interview. And to that point, I mean, look, it's it's pretty obvious that you and I. I like to find out as much as I possibly can about a person. And I always feel like I didn't even do enough research, that I didn't even scratch the surface, especially with someone like Larry Brown where can read every article that you can find. And I listened to a ton of interviews and I like to try to find places and times where he's talked about something. And it felt like he wanted to go deeper into it and wasn't asked about it. That's what that's what really interests me at the core. Like what hasn't he had a chance to reveal about himself that he would like to? And that's how I think I approach every interview. And that's been the fun part about doing all these with you is the idea that we both have that same general curiosity and we have things that we'd love to hear and answer for. And then there's also the part of like what more hasn't that person told the world that they're going to be able to tell him on this? Yes. To what's entertaining in this week, outside of you're anticipating an email back from whatever river that was where you lost your sunglasses. I'm like, listen, I'm waiting for that e-mail. I'm waiting for that. That's that's that's that's first and foremost. I'll tell you, the we talked about you talked about the when you see it, when they see us about the Central Park Five, the Netflix series on that. And what is interesting is there's a follow up to that where Oprah Winfrey interviewed the cast and the director and writer and and interviewed all five of those of those men. And it was really interesting And. to hear them on a personal level like what the the the mini series meant to them. But but I think even more importantly, just to hear the story in their words and it was so eye opening and it's so heartbreaking And. I think to me that was that was certainly the most fascinating thing that I that I saw this week, that. Winfrey interview, when they see us on on Netflix was was definitely, you know, the most intriguing thing that I came across this this week. But for you, it's certainly not my morning, that's for sure. How is not entertaining? Been watching? MORRISON I have very different interest on what we see on TV what, we watch. But we've been watching the Kaminsky Method Netflix with Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin. Danny DeVito is actually in it also. Sarah Baker, Nancy Travis and it's. Michael Douglas is this older acting coach and Alan or he was an actor and then Alan Arkin is his is his agent and then and now an Arkansas wife had cancer and she died. And so it's it's a it's it's a comedy. What is it like? Yeah, that's right. That's why I said it's actually. You guys actually did a good job. It's actually a comedy. But but there is a lot about, you know, getting older and, you know, maybe it makes me maybe it makes me get inside the heads of what what my parents are thinking. But but I did it's entertaining. And I honestly, I thought I was going to be entertained. I'll be candid with this. So I was that I was a finalist for the Washington Wizards TV play by play job. And I thought I was going to be entertaining myself this week with, you know, maybe moving to D.C. and starting starting a career in in a dream job. And they offered it to somebody else. So now it's you know, you move move on and you're always it's always good to be employed while pursuing your pursuing your dream job. But but that is that is certainly. That's certainly been on my mind this week. But the Kaminsky methods helped a little bit. All right. Well, there you go. I mean it. I do want to say I do want to say that I was extremely disappointed to hear about the Wizards job from from you. When you when you told me about that, selfishly, I was a little bit excited because I said, well, OK. No one's going to take away this this podcast that I get lucky enough to do with Noah each week. So that was awesome. But I just want you to know that there is an organization out there that's got your name all over it. And I'm excited to see where that ends up becoming, because you're a super talented guy. And I'm not just saying that because I love doing the podcast with you, but because I believe in that. And obviously our producers would go right along with that sentiment. Yeah, go on. Keep going. No, that's it. It's all I can say. Positive about you. Yeah, actually, that's all I'm obligated to. I have to say maybe I'll update my I play by play real and put that. But those sentiments at the time, I make sure everybody listens to the Mike Wise show. Also, he's got Chris Mullin on this week. We've got four podcasts on the Pure Hoops Network. Go back and listen to the Tom McCulloch interview that we did last week. Also, Will Perdue and Hall of Famers up and down the board on the court behind the mike. You'll find it's rep to think it's almost about 30 episodes, buckets, points in blocks with Monica McNutt and also the children's podcast with Eric Newman and NBA champion B.J. Armstrong. Thanks to our producers Bruce Bernstein, Scott Turk and the entire pure hoops media crew. You like that, huh? Just seamlessly thanking people now for what it is going. What is going on with me? It's a new you. It's a new spin. All these tears I shed this morning years. Oh, my goodness. I don't even know. I don't even know how to respond to that. But I will say and I think to close out the podcast in this way. Best of luck to Eden. And I hope you have a wonderful day at camp today. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you. The Catch and Shoot podcast. The presentation is pure media.
